## Critical Gaps (Must Address for Full GDPR Compliance)

### 1. Missing Privacy Documentation ❌
**Issue:** No privacy policy or terms of service templates provided
**Impact:** Organizations cannot comply with GDPR Articles 13/14 (transparency obligations)
**Fix:** Create privacy policy template in `docs/GDPR_PRIVACY_POLICY_TEMPLATE.md`

### 2. No Comprehensive Data Export Feature ⚠️
**Issue:** No `GET /api/v1/user/export-data` endpoint
**Current:** Only audit log CSV export available
**Missing:** User profile, files list, full download history in structured format
**Impact:** Partially violates GDPR Article 15 (Right of Access)
**Fix:** Add JSON/CSV export including all user data (3-5 hours of development)

### 3. No User Account Deletion UI ⚠️
**Issue:** Regular users cannot delete their own accounts (admin-only)
**Current:** Download accounts have self-service deletion
**Missing:** `/settings/delete-account` endpoint for system users
**Impact:** Limits GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure) implementation
**Fix:** Add self-service deletion UI (2-3 hours of development)

### 4. No Cookie Consent Banner ⚠️
**Issue:** No explicit cookie consent mechanism
**Current:** Uses HttpOnly functional cookies only (good security)
**Missing:** Cookie consent banner or privacy notice
**Impact:** ePrivacy Directive (2009/136/EC) requirement
**Fix:** Add dismissible banner with privacy policy link (1-2 hours)

### 5. No Data Processing Agreement Template ❌
**Issue:** B2B organizations lack DPA template
**Missing:** Article 28 compliance for processor-controller relationships
**Impact:** Organizations processing on behalf of others cannot be GDPR-compliant
**Fix:** Create DPA template in `docs/DPA_TEMPLATE.md`

---

## Important Gaps (Should Address)

### 6. No Encryption at Rest (by default) ⚠️
**Current:** Passwords hashed (good), emails plaintext (database at rest unencrypted)
**Missing:** SQLCipher or file-level encryption option
**Impact:** Security concern but not strict GDPR violation
**Recommendation:** Add encryption option for regulated industries

### 7. No Breach Detection/Alerting ⚠️
**Current:** Logs failed logins and errors
**Missing:** Automated anomaly detection, email alerts, rate limiting
**Impact:** No proactive security monitoring
**Recommendation:** Add login rate limiting (5 failures → 15-min lockout)

### 8. No Breach Notification Procedure ❌
**Issue:** No documented data breach response process
**Missing:** GDPR Article 33/34 breach notification procedure
**Impact:** Organizations cannot meet 72-hour breach notification requirement
**Fix:** Create breach response guide in documentation

## Recommended Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical (1-2 weeks)
1. Add privacy policy template (docs)
2. Implement user data export endpoint (3-5 hours)
3. Add user account deletion UI (2-3 hours)
4. Cookie consent banner (1-2 hours)

### Phase 2: Important (2-4 weeks)
1. DPA template (docs)
2. Breach notification procedure (docs)
3. Login rate limiting (2-3 hours)
4. Encryption at rest option (optional, 4-5 hours)

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Future)

## Bottom Line

**WulfVault is GDPR-compliant for most use cases** if organizations:

1. ✅ Add their own privacy policy (template to be created)
2. ✅ Implement user data export feature (3-5 hours coding)
3. ✅ Add self-service account deletion (2-3 hours coding)
4. ✅ Deploy with HTTPS/TLS
5. ✅ Configure audit log retention per jurisdiction

**For regulated industries** (Healthcare, Finance, Government):
- Add encryption at rest (SQLCipher)
- Implement breach notification procedure
- Create data processing agreement
- Add security monitoring/alerting

**Code Quality:** Excellent - comprehensive audit logging, secure password hashing, 2FA support, role-based access control all implemented correctly.

**Missing Pieces:** Documentation (privacy policy, DPA, consent) and user-facing data export feature.
