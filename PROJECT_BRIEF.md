# Manvarg Sharecare File Sharing System
## Open Source Alternative to WeTransfer

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

Build a lightweight, self-hosted file sharing system branded as **Manvarg Sharecare**. This is an open-source alternative to WeTransfer/Sprend, inspired by Gokapi but simpler and tailored for surveillance system customers.

**Core Purpose**: Provide Manvarg customers (especially those with Milestone XProtect video surveillance systems) a branded file sharing service as part of their service agreements, since XProtect lacks built-in file sharing like OpenEye systems have.

---

## 🎨 BRANDING REQUIREMENTS

### Visual Identity
- **Brand Name**: Manvarg Sharecare
- **Colors**:
  - Primary: Manvarg blue/security colors (to be extracted from logo)
  - Secondary: Professional dark/light contrast
  - Accent: Trust-inspiring colors
- **Logo Integration**:
  - Manvarg logo must be prominent on all pages
  - Header/navigation bar
  - Login pages
  - Email templates
  - Download pages
  - Admin dashboard

### Design Inspiration
- **WeTransfer**: Clean, minimal interface with focus on the upload/download action
- **Sprend**: Professional, secure feeling
- **Gokapi**: Simple, straightforward file management
- **Goal**: Create a professional, trustworthy interface that screams "security company"

---

## 👥 USER ROLES & AUTHENTICATION

### 1. Admin Users
- Created via admin panel during setup
- Can create/manage regular users
- Can view all files and downloads across system
- Can set global policies
- Can manage storage quotas per user/folder

### 2. Regular Users (Customers)
- Created by admins (no self-registration)
- Must authenticate to upload files
- Can create shareable links with optional download authentication
- Can view their own file statistics
- Have assigned storage quota
- Have assigned folder/directory space

### 3. File Recipients (Download Users)
- **Two modes**:
  1. **Authenticated Downloads**: Recipient must create download account with email + password
  2. **Direct Links**: No authentication required (for quick shares)

---

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & TRACKING

### Upload Authentication
- Only authenticated users (created by admin) can upload files
- Session-based login
- JWT tokens for API access

### Download Tracking
**For Authenticated Downloads**:
- Recipient provides email + creates password on first download
- System creates temporary download account
- Tracks:
  - Email address
  - Download timestamps
  - Number of downloads
  - IP address (optional, for security)
  - User agent (optional)

**For Direct Links**:
- No authentication required
- Still track:
  - Number of downloads
  - Download timestamps
  - Basic analytics (IP ranges, not stored permanently)

---

## 📁 FILE SHARING FEATURES

### File Upload & Management
- Drag-and-drop upload interface
- Multiple file uploads
- Progress indicators
- File deduplication (same file = same storage)
- Preview for common file types (images, PDFs)

### Link Generation
- **Random hash-based URLs** (like Gokapi): `https://your-domain.com/d/AbC123XyZ`
- Hash must be cryptographically secure and unpredictable
- Two link types:
  1. **Authenticated Link**: Requires recipient to create download account
  2. **Direct Link**: Open access, no login needed

### File Expiration & Limits
- Set expiration by:
  - Number of downloads (e.g., 5 downloads then delete)
  - Time period (e.g., 7 days then delete)
  - Combination (whichever comes first)
- Manual deletion by uploader
- Admin can delete any file

### Email Integration
- Send download link via email directly from system
- Email template branded with Manvarg Sharecare
- Include:
  - File name and size
  - Expiration info
  - Download instructions
  - Manvarg branding/logo

---

## 📊 STORAGE MANAGEMENT

### Per-User Quotas
- Admin sets maximum storage per user
- User dashboard shows:
  - Current usage
  - Available space
  - Number of active files

### Multi-Directory Support
- Admin can create multiple "storage folders/categories"
- Each folder can have its own quota
- Use case: Different quotas for different customer tiers
- Example:
  - `basic-customers/` - 5GB quota
  - `premium-customers/` - 50GB quota
  - `video-archive/` - 500GB quota

### Storage Optimization
- File deduplication (identical files stored once)
- Automatic cleanup of expired files
- Admin dashboard shows total storage usage

---

## 📈 ANALYTICS & REPORTING

### User Dashboard
- My uploaded files
- Total downloads per file
- Active vs expired files
- Storage usage

### Admin Dashboard
- Total system usage
- Active users
- Total files shared
- Most active users
- Storage trends
- Per-file download statistics with recipient tracking

### Download Tracking Details
For each file, show:
- Total downloads
- List of download accounts (email + timestamps)
- Download count per recipient
- Geographic distribution (optional)
- Time-based download graph

---

---

## 💡 NOTES FOR CLAUDE CODE

- **Start Simple**: Build MVP first, then add features
- **Security First**: This handles potentially sensitive video evidence
- **Test on Windows**: XProtect runs on Windows, test there
- **Email Early**: Don't leave email integration for last
- **Branding Everywhere**: Every page should scream "Manvarg Sharecare"
- **Think Multi-Instance**: Each deployment is independent
- **Document as You Go**: Don't leave docs for the end

**Most Important**: This needs to be production-ready, not a prototype. It will handle real customer files and potentially legal evidence from surveillance systems.

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS VISION

Imagine a Manvarg customer who just exported a video from their XProtect system showing a break-in. They:

1. Log into `files.manvarg.se` with their customer account
2. Drag the 2GB video file into the browser
3. Set it to expire after 5 downloads or 30 days
4. Enter the police officer's email
5. Click "Send"
6. The officer receives a professional email with Manvarg branding
7. Opens the link, creates a download account (email + password)
8. Downloads the video
9. Customer sees: "Downloaded by officer.svensson@police.se on 2024-11-08"
10. Customer feels confident using Manvarg's complete security solution

**That's the goal.**
