## [3.1.2] - 2025-11-11 🔧 Critical Upload Timeout Fix

### Bug Fixes
- **Critical Upload Timeout Fix**: Fixed 60-second timeout causing large file uploads to fail at ~60%

  - Fixes "Upload Failed - Network Error" for files taking longer than 60 seconds to upload
  - Critical fix for 1TB+ file uploads or slower network connections

### Technical Details
- ReadHeaderTimeout: 60 seconds - for request headers only (not body)

  - This allows users to upload multi-gigabyte files even on slow internet connections
  - Server now supports uploads taking up to 8 hours to complete
- **Maximum File Size Limit**: Increased from 5GB to 150GB
  - UI now reflects the new 150GB maximum file size limit
  - Suitable for large video files, backups, and forensic data

### Technical Details
- WriteTimeout: 8 hours (28,800 seconds) - for large file transfers
- ReadTimeout: 60 seconds - for request header processing
- IdleTimeout: 120 seconds - for keep-alive connections
