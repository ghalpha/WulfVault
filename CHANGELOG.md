## [3.2.2-RC3] - 2025-11-12 🔧 Critical Bug Fix

### Bug Fixes
- **🐛 CRITICAL: Localhost URL Override**: Fixed server URL defaulting to localhost when port ≠ 8080
  - Problem: When using custom port (e.g., 3000), SERVER_URL was being overridden with "http://localhost:3000"
  - Impact: Download links broke when using custom domains with non-standard ports
  - Solution: Removed automatic localhost fallback in `getPublicURL()` function
  - Now properly uses configured SERVER_URL regardless of port

### Details
- Modified `internal/server/server.go:getPublicURL()` to trust SERVER_URL environment variable
- Only port is appended if SERVER_URL doesn't already contain it
- Prevents production issues when running on non-standard ports with custom domains

## [3.2-RC2] - 2025-11-12 🚀 Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard

### New Features - Extended Dashboard Analytics
This release adds extensive new analytics capabilities to the admin dashboard, providing deep insights into usage patterns, security posture, file statistics, and trends.

#### 📈 Usage Statistics
- **Active Files**: Track files downloaded in last 7 and 30 days
- **Average File Size**: Monitor typical file sizes across the platform
- **Average Downloads per File**: Understand file popularity and sharing patterns

#### 🔐 Security Overview
- **2FA Adoption Rate**: Track percentage of Users/Admins with Two-Factor Authentication enabled
- **Average Backup Codes Remaining**: Monitor backup code usage to identify users who may need to regenerate

#### 📁 File Statistics
- **Largest File**: Display the biggest file currently stored with size
- **Most Active User**: Highlight the user who has uploaded the most files

#### ⚡ Trend Data
- **Top File Types**: Show the 3 most common file extensions with counts
- **Most Active Weekday**: Identify which day of the week has the most download activity
- **Storage Trend**: Display storage growth over the last 30 days with percentage change

### Bug Fixes
- **🐛 Critical: Historical Data Accuracy**: Fixed bug where deleting files would retroactively remove them from historical statistics
  - Previously, when a file was deleted, ALL statistics (uploaded/downloaded data for all periods) would decrease
  - Now statistics correctly reflect historical data - if a file was uploaded in January, it remains in the year's upload statistics even after deletion
  - Affects: `GetBytesUploadedToday/Week/Month/Year()` - removed `AND DeletedAt = 0` clause
  - Download statistics were already correct (using DownloadLogs) but added clarifying comments

### Implementation Details
- **New Database Methods** (15 new methods in `internal/database/`):
  - Usage: `GetActiveFilesLast7Days()`, `GetActiveFilesLast30Days()`, `GetAverageFileSize()`, `GetAverageDownloadsPerFile()`
  - Security: `Get2FAAdoptionRate()`, `GetAverageBackupCodesRemaining()`
  - Files: `GetLargestFile()`, `GetMostActiveUser()`
  - Trends: `GetTopFileTypes()`, `GetMostActiveWeekday()`, `GetStorageTrendLastMonth()`
- **Dashboard UI**: 5 new sections with 14 additional stat cards
- **Performance**: All queries optimized with proper aggregation and indexing

### Benefits
- **Complete Visibility**: Admins now have comprehensive insights into platform usage
- **Proactive Security**: Monitor 2FA adoption and identify users needing attention
- **Trend Analysis**: Understand usage patterns to inform capacity planning
- **Historical Accuracy**: Statistics now correctly represent historical data regardless of deletions

## [3.2-beta4] - 2025-11-12 📊 Data Transfer Statistics Enhancement

### New Features
- **📊 Enhanced Data Transfer Dashboard**: Split statistics into Downloaded and Uploaded data
  - **📥 Downloaded Data**: Displays data transferred to users (4 cards: Today, This Week, This Month, This Year)
  - **📤 Uploaded Data**: Displays data uploaded by users (4 cards: Today, This Week, This Month, This Year)
  - Beautiful gradient designs for each card to distinguish downloaded vs uploaded stats
  - Real-time tracking of both upload and download bandwidth usage

### Implementation Details
- **Database Methods**: 4 new methods added to track uploads separately
  - `GetBytesUploadedToday()` - Tracks uploads from start of day
  - `GetBytesUploadedThisWeek()` - Tracks uploads from start of week (Monday)
  - `GetBytesUploadedThisMonth()` - Tracks uploads from start of month
  - `GetBytesUploadedThisYear()` - Tracks uploads from start of year
- **Query Logic**: Upload stats query Files table by UploadDate (excludes soft-deleted files)
- **Download Stats**: Existing methods query DownloadLogs with Files join for accurate size tracking
- **Dashboard UI**: Two separate sections with 8 total cards (4 downloaded + 4 uploaded)

### Benefits
- Better visibility into upload vs download bandwidth consumption
- Helps identify patterns in user behavior
- Useful for capacity planning and quota management
