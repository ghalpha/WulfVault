**README Updates:**
- Corrected Docker installation to require git clone and local build
- Updated Docker Compose examples to build from source
- Fixed default admin email to `admin@wulfvault.local`
- Updated all troubleshooting references to use correct binary and service names

### ✨ Database Migration

**Automatic Database Rename:**
- Added automatic migration logic in `internal/database/database.go`
- Old `sharecare.db` files are automatically renamed to `wulfvault.db` on startup
- Preserves existing user data seamlessly without manual intervention
- Handles edge cases (both files exist, only new file exists, etc.)
- Logs migration progress for transparency

### 📝 Attribution Improvements

- Changed "Based on Gokapi" to "Inspired by Gokapi" in startup message
- Changed "Based on" to "Inspired by" in INSTALLATION.md footer
- Aligns with NOTICE.md clarification that WulfVault is architecturally inspired by, not based on, Gokapi
- More accurately reflects the ~95% new code and complete rewrite nature of the project

### 📁 Modified Files

**Documentation:**
- `INSTALLATION.md`: Complete rewrite of Docker deployment section with correct image building
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Updated all paths, service names, and commands
- `README.md`: Fixed installation examples, credentials, and troubleshooting

**Code:**
- `cmd/server/main.go`: Version bump to 4.0.2 and attribution update (line 25, 40)
- `internal/database/database.go`: Added automatic database migration logic (lines 31-48)

### 🎯 Why This Release?

Installation guides were completely broken - they referenced non-existent Docker images causing "repository does not exist" errors. Users testing fresh installs on Debian 13 and other systems were unable to deploy WulfVault. This release provides working installation instructions that actually work out of the box, along with automatic database migration to ensure smooth upgrades for existing users.

This was reported by a user who encountered the issue during fresh installation testing and required immediate fixing.

**Logo Image Validation**
- **Issue Fixed**: Broken logo image in welcome email if logo data invalid
- **Solution**: Validates logo data format before including in email
- **Validation**: Checks that logo starts with `data:image/` (valid data URI)
- **Fallback**: Removes logo from email if invalid, email still sends successfully

### Technical Details

**Modified Files:**
- `internal/server/handlers_admin.go` (lines 205-217):
  - Added HTTPS → HTTP URL correction for email links
  - Added logo data validation (must be valid data URI)

4. Click Save
5. User receives branded welcome email immediately

**User Experience:**
1. Receives professional welcome email with company branding
2. Email includes their login email and a "Set Password & Login" button

## [3.3.3] - 2025-11-12 🐛 Critical User Deletion Fix

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

**User Deletion Now Works**
- **Issue Fixed**: Admin user deletion button appeared to do nothing - users weren't deleted
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript `deleteUser()` function reloaded page without validating server response
- **Solution**: Implemented proper async/await pattern with response validation
- **Impact**: Users can now be successfully deleted via admin panel, files properly moved to trash

**Trash Display for Deleted Users**
- **Issue Fixed**: Files from deleted users showed "Unknown" as owner in trash view
- **Solution**: Changed default display text to "Deleted user" for better clarity

- **Solution**: Added fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')` for HTTP contexts
- **Impact**: Copy button now works reliably on both HTTP and HTTPS connections

**Technical Details:**
- `internal/server/handlers_admin.go`: Improved copy function with dual-method approach
  - Primary: Modern clipboard API (for HTTPS)
  - Fallback: execCommand (for HTTP - more compatible)
- Better error handling with user-friendly messages

---

## [3.3.1] - 2025-11-12 🔧 Critical Configuration Fix

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

**Server URL Configuration Priority Fixed**

## [3.2.2-RC3] - 2025-11-12 🔧 Critical Bug Fix

### Bug Fixes
- **🐛 CRITICAL: Localhost URL Override**: Fixed server URL defaulting to localhost when port ≠ 8080
  - Problem: When using custom port (e.g., 3000), SERVER_URL was being overridden with "http://localhost:3000"
  - Impact: Download links broke when using custom domains with non-standard ports
  - Solution: Removed automatic localhost fallback in `getPublicURL()` function
  - Now properly uses configured SERVER_URL regardless of port

### Details
- Modified `internal/server/server.go:getPublicURL()` to trust SERVER_URL environment variable
- Only port is appended if SERVER_URL doesn't already contain it
- Prevents production issues when running on non-standard ports with custom domains

---

## [3.2-RC2] - 2025-11-12 🚀 Comprehensive Analytics Dashboard

#### 📈 Usage Statistics
- **Active Files**: Track files downloaded in last 7 and 30 days
- **Average File Size**: Monitor typical file sizes across the platform
- **Average Downloads per File**: Understand file popularity and sharing patterns

#### 🔐 Security Overview
- **2FA Adoption Rate**: Track percentage of Users/Admins with Two-Factor Authentication enabled

  - Previously, when a file was deleted, ALL statistics (uploaded/downloaded data for all periods) would decrease
  - Now statistics correctly reflect historical data - if a file was uploaded in January, it remains in the year's upload statistics even after deletion
  - Affects: `GetBytesUploadedToday/Week/Month/Year()` - removed `AND DeletedAt = 0` clause
  - Download statistics were already correct (using DownloadLogs) but added clarifying comments

### Implementation Details
- **New Database Methods** (15 new methods in `internal/database/`):
  - Usage: `GetActiveFilesLast7Days()`, `GetActiveFilesLast30Days()`, `GetAverageFileSize()`, `GetAverageDownloadsPerFile()`
  - Security: `Get2FAAdoptionRate()`, `GetAverageBackupCodesRemaining()`
  - Files: `GetLargestFile()`, `GetMostActiveUser()`
  - Trends: `GetTopFileTypes()`, `GetMostActiveWeekday()`, `GetStorageTrendLastMonth()`
- **Dashboard UI**: 5 new sections with 14 additional stat cards
- **Performance**: All queries optimized with proper aggregation and indexing

### Benefits
- **Complete Visibility**: Admins now have comprehensive insights into platform usage
- **Proactive Security**: Monitor 2FA adoption and identify users needing attention
