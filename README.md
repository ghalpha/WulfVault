## Server Restart Feature

The Admin Settings page includes a **"Restart Server"** button that is **currently disabled** until systemd service is installed.

### Why is it disabled?

The restart button requires a process manager (systemd, supervisor, etc.) to automatically restart the server after shutdown. Without this, clicking the button will stop the server without restarting it.

### How to enable it

1. **Install systemd service** (requires sudo):
   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/wulfvault.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable wulfvault
   sudo systemctl start wulfvault
   ```

2. **Uncomment the restart button** in the code:
   - Open `internal/server/handlers_admin.go`
   - Find the section marked `<!-- RESTART SERVER BUTTON - DISABLED`
   - Remove the `<!--` and `-->` comment markers
   - Also uncomment the JavaScript function at the bottom
   - Rebuild: `go build -o wulfvault cmd/server/main.go`
   - Restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart wulfvault`

3. **The button will now work!** It will use `systemctl restart wulfvault` to gracefully restart the server.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment and autostart instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't login with default credentials

Make sure you're using:
- Email: `admin@wulfvault.local`
- Password: `WulfVaultAdmin2024!`

If it still doesn't work, check the server logs for initialization errors.

### Files not uploading

- Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` environment variable
- Verify user has available storage quota
- Check disk space on server
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors

### Download links not working

- Verify `SERVER_URL` is set correctly in environment
- Check that files haven't expired
- Ensure file wasn't deleted or moved to trash
- Check server logs for errors

### More help

- Check [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup
- Review logs: `docker compose logs -f wulfvault`
- Open issue on GitHub: https://github.com/Frimurare/WulfVault/issues
