# Sharecare - Enterprise File Sharing Platform

**Version 3.0.0** | **Production Ready** | **Self-Hosted** | **Open Source**

Sharecare is a professional-grade, self-hosted file sharing platform designed for organizations that demand security, accountability, and complete control over their data. Built with Go for exceptional performance and reliability, Sharecare eliminates the need for expensive cloud-based file transfer services while providing enterprise features like multi-user management, granular storage quotas, comprehensive audit trails, and automatic password reset functionality.

**Perfect for:** Law enforcement agencies, healthcare providers, legal firms, creative agencies, and any organization handling sensitive or large files that require detailed download tracking and GDPR compliance.

## Why Sharecare?

Many organizations need to share large files regularly but face challenges:
- Commercial file transfer services charge high fees per user or transfer
- Large video files (surveillance footage, recordings) exceed typical email limits
- Need to know exactly who downloaded what and when for compliance
- Want complete control over data security and retention

Sharecare solves this by providing:
- Self-hosted solution - your data stays on your infrastructure
- No per-transfer costs or user limits
- Complete download tracking with email addresses and timestamps
- Customizable storage quotas per user
- Support for files up to 5GB+ (configurable)

## Use Cases

### Large Video File Sharing
Organizations with surveillance systems or video production need to share large video exports:
- Export video footage (often 1GB+ files)
- Upload to Sharecare with expiration and authentication
- Share link with investigators, management, or customers
- Track exactly who downloaded the footage and when
- Maintain complete audit trail for legal compliance

### Secure Document Distribution
Share sensitive documents with accountability:
- Service agreements and contracts
- System documentation and manuals
- Evidence files requiring chain of custody
- Financial reports with download tracking

### Team File Collaboration
Internal file sharing for distributed teams:
- Large design files and CAD drawings
- Project deliverables too large for email
- Marketing materials and video content
- Backup distribution to remote locations

### Requesting Files from Others
Create upload request links for:
- Collecting files from customers or contractors
- Receiving large files without email attachments
- Temporary upload portals with size and time limits
- Anonymous file submission with tracking

## API

Sharecare provides a REST API for automation and integrations.

**Basic endpoints:**
- `/api/upload` - Upload files programmatically
- `/api/files` - List user's files
- `/api/download/:id` - Download file by ID

**Authentication:** API requests require session cookies or token-based auth.

See full API documentation in [API.md](docs/API.md) (coming soon).

---

## Security

### Default Security Features

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Secure random hash generation for download links (128-bit entropy)
- Session tokens with automatic expiration (24 hours)
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Files stored outside web root with access control
- IP address logging for all downloads
- No directory listing or file enumeration

### Recommended Production Setup

1. **Change default admin password immediately**
2. **Use HTTPS** - Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) with SSL
3. **Enable firewall** - Only expose ports 80/443
4. **Regular backups** - Backup `./data` and `./uploads` directories
5. **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious download patterns
6. **Update regularly** - Keep Sharecare up to date
7. **Strong passwords** - Enforce password policies for all users

---

## Server Restart Feature

The Admin Settings page includes a **"Restart Server"** button that is **currently disabled** until systemd service is installed.

### Why is it disabled?

The restart button requires a process manager (systemd, supervisor, etc.) to automatically restart the server after shutdown. Without this, clicking the button will stop the server without restarting it.

### How to enable it

1. **Install systemd service** (requires sudo):
   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/sharecare.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable sharecare
   sudo systemctl start sharecare
   ```

2. **Uncomment the restart button** in the code:
   - Open `internal/server/handlers_admin.go`
   - Find the section marked `<!-- RESTART SERVER BUTTON - DISABLED`
   - Remove the `<!--` and `-->` comment markers
   - Also uncomment the JavaScript function at the bottom
   - Rebuild: `go build -o sharecare cmd/server/main.go`
   - Restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart sharecare`

3. **The button will now work!** It will use `systemctl restart sharecare` to gracefully restart the server.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment and autostart instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't login with default credentials

Make sure you're using:
- Email: `admin@sharecare.local`
- Password: `SharecareAdmin2024!`

If it still doesn't work, check the server logs for initialization errors.

### Files not uploading

- Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` environment variable
- Verify user has available storage quota
- Check disk space on server
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors

### Download links not working

- Verify `SERVER_URL` is set correctly in environment
- Check that files haven't expired
- Ensure file wasn't deleted or moved to trash
- Check server logs for errors

### More help

- Check [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup
- Review logs: `docker-compose logs -f sharecare`
- Open issue on GitHub: https://github.com/Frimurare/Sharecare/issues
