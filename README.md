# WulfVault - Enterprise File Sharing Platform

**Version 4.0.2** | **Self-Hosted** | **Open Source** | **AGPL-3.0**

WulfVault is a professional-grade, self-hosted file sharing platform designed for organizations that demand security, accountability, and complete control over their data. Built with Go for exceptional performance and reliability, WulfVault provides a complete alternative to commercial file transfer services, eliminating subscription costs while offering superior features: multi-user management with role-based access, per-user storage quotas, comprehensive audit trails with email tracking, branded download pages, two-factor authentication, self-service password management, file request portals, and GDPR-compliant account deletion.

**Perfect for:** Law enforcement agencies, healthcare providers, legal firms, creative agencies, government departments, educational institutions, and any organization handling sensitive or large files that require detailed download tracking, compliance documentation, and enterprise-grade security.

**Architecturally inspired by [Gokapi](https://github.com/Forceu/Gokapi)** — WulfVault is a complete rewrite (~95% new code) adding multi-user management, audit logging, email integration, 2FA, branding, and enterprise features.

WulfVault solves this by providing:
- Self-hosted solution - your data stays on your infrastructure
- No per-transfer costs or user limits
- Complete download tracking with email addresses and timestamps
- Customizable storage quotas per user

## API

WulfVault provides a REST API for automation and integrations.

**Basic endpoints:**
- `/api/upload` - Upload files programmatically
- `/api/files` - List user's files
- `/api/download/:id` - Download file by ID

**Authentication:** API requests require session cookies or token-based auth.

See full API documentation in [API.md](docs/API.md) (coming soon).

## Security

### Default Security Features

- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- Secure random hash generation for download links (128-bit entropy)
- Session tokens with automatic expiration (24 hours)
- CSRF protection via SameSite cookies
- Files stored outside web root with access control
- IP address logging for all downloads
- No directory listing or file enumeration

### Recommended Production Setup

1. **Change default admin password immediately**
2. **Use HTTPS** - Deploy behind reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) with SSL
3. **Enable firewall** - Only expose ports 80/443
4. **Regular backups** - Backup `./data` and `./uploads` directories
5. **Monitor logs** - Watch for suspicious download patterns
6. **Update regularly** - Keep WulfVault up to date
7. **Strong passwords** - Enforce password policies for all users

---

## Server Restart Feature

The Admin Settings page includes a **"Restart Server"** button that is **currently disabled** until systemd service is installed.

### Why is it disabled?

The restart button requires a process manager (systemd, supervisor, etc.) to automatically restart the server after shutdown. Without this, clicking the button will stop the server without restarting it.

### How to enable it

1. **Install systemd service** (requires sudo):
   ```bash
   sudo cp /tmp/wulfvault.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable wulfvault
   sudo systemctl start wulfvault
   ```

2. **Uncomment the restart button** in the code:
   - Open `internal/server/handlers_admin.go`
   - Find the section marked `<!-- RESTART SERVER BUTTON - DISABLED`
   - Remove the `<!--` and `-->` comment markers
   - Also uncomment the JavaScript function at the bottom
   - Rebuild: `go build -o wulfvault cmd/server/main.go`
   - Restart the service: `sudo systemctl restart wulfvault`

3. **The button will now work!** It will use `systemctl restart wulfvault` to gracefully restart the server.

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for complete deployment and autostart instructions.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't login with default credentials

Make sure you're using:
- Email: `admin@wulfvault.local`
- Password: `WulfVaultAdmin2024!`

If it still doesn't work, check the server logs for initialization errors.

### Files not uploading

- Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` environment variable
- Verify user has available storage quota
- Check disk space on server
- Review browser console for JavaScript errors

### Download links not working

- Verify `SERVER_URL` is set correctly in environment
- Check that files haven't expired
- Ensure file wasn't deleted or moved to trash
- Check server logs for errors

### More help

- Check [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for detailed setup
- Review logs: `docker compose logs -f wulfvault`
- Open issue on GitHub: https://github.com/Frimurare/WulfVault/issues
