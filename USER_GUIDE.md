## Configuration

Sharecare can be configured through environment variables, command-line flags, and the web interface.

### Environment Variables

All configuration can be set via environment variables. These are the primary way to configure Sharecare in Docker deployments.

#### Complete Variable Reference

| Variable | Description | Default Value | Requires Restart |
|----------|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| `SERVER_URL` | Public URL where Sharecare is accessible | `http://localhost:8080` | ❌ No* |
| `PORT` | Port the server listens on | `8080` | ✅ Yes |
| `DATA_DIR` | Directory for database storage | `./data` | ✅ Yes |
| `UPLOADS_DIR` | Directory for uploaded files | `./uploads` | ✅ Yes |
| `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` | Maximum file size in megabytes | `2000` (2 GB) | ❌ No* |
| `DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB` | Default storage quota for new users | `5000` (5 GB) | ❌ No* |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS` | Session expiration time in hours | `24` | ✅ Yes |
| `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` | Days to keep deleted files in trash | `5` | ❌ No* |

**Note:** Variables marked with * can be changed via Admin Settings in the web interface and take effect immediately. Environment variables override web settings on startup.

### How to Set Environment Variables

#### Method 1: Docker Run Command

When starting Sharecare with `docker run`, use `-e` flags:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name sharecare \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v ./data:/data \
  -v ./uploads:/uploads \
  -e SERVER_URL=https://files.yourdomain.com \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5000 \
  -e DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB=10000 \
  -e SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS=48 \
  -e TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS=7 \
  frimurare/sharecare:latest
```

**Example with all variables:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  --name sharecare \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /mnt/sharecare-data:/data \
  -v /mnt/sharecare-uploads:/uploads \
  -e SERVER_URL=https://files.company.com \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e DATA_DIR=/data \
  -e UPLOADS_DIR=/uploads \
  -e MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5000 \
  -e DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB=20000 \
  -e SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS=24 \
  -e TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS=30 \
  frimurare/sharecare:latest
```

#### Method 2: Docker Compose

Create or edit `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  sharecare:
    image: frimurare/sharecare:latest
    container_name: sharecare
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./uploads:/uploads
    environment:
      # Required: Set your public URL
      SERVER_URL: https://files.yourdomain.com

      # Optional: Customize these as needed
      PORT: 8080
      DATA_DIR: /data
      UPLOADS_DIR: /data
      MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: 2000          # 2 GB default
      DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB: 5000          # 5 GB default per user
      SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS: 24       # 24 hours default
      TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS: 5         # 5 days default
    restart: unless-stopped
```

**Start with:**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Restart after changes:**
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Method 3: Binary Executable (Command Line)

When running the compiled binary directly, use flags:

```bash
./sharecare \
  -url=https://files.yourdomain.com \
  -port=8080 \
  -data=./data \
  -uploads=./uploads
```

**Available flags:**
- `-url` → SERVER_URL
- `-port` → PORT
- `-data` → DATA_DIR
- `-uploads` → UPLOADS_DIR

**Note:** File size limits, quotas, session timeout, and trash retention can only be set via environment variables or web interface, not command-line flags.

#### Method 4: Environment File (.env)

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# .env file for Sharecare configuration

# Server Configuration
SERVER_URL=https://files.yourdomain.com
PORT=8080
DATA_DIR=/data
UPLOADS_DIR=/uploads

# File and Storage Limits
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=2000
DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB=5000

# Security and Retention
SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS=24
TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS=5
```

**Use with Docker Compose:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  sharecare:
    image: frimurare/sharecare:latest
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - "${PORT}:${PORT}"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
      - ./uploads:/uploads
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Configuration Priority

Settings are applied in this order (later overrides earlier):

1. **Default values** (hardcoded in application)
2. **Environment variables** (set at container/process start)
3. **Command-line flags** (when using binary)
4. **Web interface settings** (stored in database)

**Example:**
- Default: `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=2000`
- Environment variable: `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB=5000` → Overrides default
- Admin Settings page: Set to 3000 MB → Overrides environment variable

### Runtime vs Restart-Required Changes

#### Can be changed without restart (via Admin Settings):
- ✅ `SERVER_URL` - Change via Admin → Settings
- ✅ `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` - Change via Admin → Settings
- ✅ `DEFAULT_QUOTA_MB` - Change via Admin → Settings
- ✅ `TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS` - Change via Admin → Settings
- ✅ Branding (logo, colors, company name)
- ✅ Per-user storage quotas

#### Requires container/service restart:
- ⚠️ `PORT` - Change requires restart
- ⚠️ `DATA_DIR` - Change requires restart
- ⚠️ `UPLOADS_DIR` - Change requires restart
- ⚠️ `SESSION_TIMEOUT_HOURS` - Change requires restart

### Common Configuration Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Increase File Size Limit

**Quick (no restart):**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin → Settings
3. Change "Max File Size (MB)" to desired value
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. ✅ Takes effect immediately

**Permanent (with environment variable):**
```bash
docker-compose down
# Edit docker-compose.yml - add or change:
#   MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: 5000
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Scenario 2: Change Port

**Requires restart:**
```bash
docker-compose down
# Edit docker-compose.yml:
#   ports:
#     - "3000:3000"
#   environment:
#     PORT: 3000
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Scenario 3: Increase User Quotas

**For existing users:**
1. Admin → Users
2. Click edit on user
3. Change "Storage Quota" value
4. Save

**For new users (default):**
1. Admin → Settings
2. Change "Default User Quota (MB)"
3. Save
4. ✅ Applies to users created after this change

#### Scenario 4: Custom Domain Setup

**Step 1: Set environment variable**
```yaml
environment:
  SERVER_URL: https://files.company.com
```

**Step 2: Restart container**
```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 3: Verify in Admin → Settings**
- Should show your domain
- Download links will use this URL

#### Scenario 5: Extended Trash Retention

**Option A: Environment variable (permanent)**
```yaml
environment:
  TRASH_RETENTION_DAYS: 30
```

**Option B: Admin Settings (runtime)**
1. Admin → Settings
2. "Trash Retention Period (Days)" → 30
3. Save
4. ✅ Effective immediately

### Verifying Configuration

#### Check Current Settings

**Via Admin Dashboard:**
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin → Settings
3. See all current values

**Via Docker logs:**
```bash
docker logs sharecare

# Output shows:
# Sharecare File Sharing System v3.2.3
# Server starting on :8080
# Server URL: https://files.yourdomain.com
```

**Via environment inspection:**
```bash
docker exec sharecare env | grep -E "SERVER_URL|PORT|MAX_FILE"
```

### Troubleshooting Configuration

#### Problem: Changes not taking effect

**Solution:**
1. Check if change requires restart (see table above)
2. For Docker: `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`
3. Check logs: `docker logs sharecare`
4. Verify no syntax errors in docker-compose.yml

#### Problem: Download links use wrong URL

**Solution:**
1. Set `SERVER_URL` environment variable correctly
2. Do NOT include port if using standard 80/443
3. Do NOT include trailing slash
4. Example: `https://files.company.com` not `https://files.company.com:8080/`

#### Problem: File uploads fail with size error

**Solution:**
1. Check `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` setting
2. Ensure reverse proxy (nginx/Caddy) allows large uploads
3. For nginx, set: `client_max_body_size 5000M;`
